    "Imagine harnessing the power of machine learning to predict one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases: breast cancer. As data science enthusiasts, we often seek new challenges to expand our skills and dive into unexplored territories. This journey not only enhances our technical prowess but also broadens our understanding of diverse fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article invites you to venture beyond the realms of `digital marketing` and `media investment` into the captivating world of `healthcare`. Did you know that cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 9.6 million deaths in 2018, according to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer#:~:text=Cancer%20is%20the%20second%20leading,-%20and%20middle-income%20countries.)? This staggering statistic underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions in early detection and treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Join me as we explore how machine learning can be a game-changer in predicting breast cancer symptoms. We'll utilize a comprehensive dataset from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29), generously provided by academicians, to build our predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bring this vision to life, we'll employ powerful Python libraries like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). These tools will help us explore, clean, and visualize data, ultimately leading to a robust machine learning model. Ready to embark on this exciting adventure? Let's break it down into manageable steps:\n",

    "\n",
    "Much like any other data exploratory process in Pandas or Python, the initial phase involves loading the essential libraries into our working Jupyter Notebook environment. These libraries are the backbone of our data analysis and machine learning endeavors, providing us with the tools needed to manipulate, visualize, and model our data. Whether you're using Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or Kaggle, the process remains largely the same. These platforms offer robust environments that support Python and its libraries, making them ideal for data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, I'll stick to my faithful Jupyter Notebook environment, known for its versatility and user-friendly interface. Jupyter Notebook allows for an interactive data analysis experience, where code, visualizations, and explanatory text can coexist seamlessly. This setup will enable us to document our process comprehensively and adjust our code on the fly as we delve into the breast cancer dataset. While you're free to use any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) you prefer, Jupyter Notebook's integration with libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn makes it an excellent choice for this step-by-step guide."

For the purpose of this walkthrough, let's name the directory `Project`. This will serve as our main working directory. Navigate into the `Project` folder, as this will be our base for organizing and executing the steps outlined in this tutorial. The next step is to download the breast cancer dataset from the [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29) site, which we'll use for our machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the `Project` directory, create a new folder named `data` and copy the downloaded CSV file into this `data` directory. This organization ensures that all relevant files are neatly stored and easily accessible throughout the tutorial. By structuring our project this way, we facilitate a smooth workflow and maintain order as we progress. Now that everything is set up, we can load the dataset into our Jupyter Notebook. This step allows us to examine, manipulate, and observe the data, laying the groundwork for our machine learning exploration."

    "Once we have completed the initial setup, we can proceed to analyze our dataset further. A common starting point in any data analysis project is to understand the size of the dataset. You might be wondering, just how large is our dataset? This question is easily answered using the `.shape` method in Pandas. \n",

    "By applying the `.shape` method to our dataset, we can quickly obtain the number of rows and columns. This method returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the dataset, giving us an immediate sense of its scale.

Knowing the types of data in each column helps us groove through the feature generation phase with ease.\n",

This insight is like the smooth rhythm of a jazz tune, guiding us to apply the right transformations and manipulations. When we're in sync with our data, everything just flows better, leading to more accurate and reliable models. To get this vibe going, we'll use the `.dtypes` attribute in Pandas. It’s our backstage pass to the inner workings of the dataset, giving us a clear overview of the structure and content. Let's get jazzy with our data and see what it’s composed of!"

    "- `Patient ID`: id number\n",

    "- `Bland Chromatin`: 1–10\n",
    "- `Normal Nucleoli`: 1–10\n",
    "- `Mitoses`: 1–10\n",
    "- `Class`: malignant or benign\n",
    "- `Doctor name`: 4 different doctors\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what’s the vibe here? The `Patient ID` is our unique identifier, ensuring each record stands out. The `Class` column is the headline act, telling us whether the tumor is `malignant` (cancerous) or `benign` (not cancerous). The rest of the columns? They're numeric medical descriptions of the tumor, except for `Doctor name`, which adds a categorical twist.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Keep this in mind—if our goal is to predict whether a tumor is cancerous based on the other features, we’ll need to perform some one-hot encoding on the categorical data and clean up the numerical data. Just like tuning an instrument before a jam session, prepping our data ensures everything flows smoothly in our analysis."

    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll use the `.head()` method in Pandas, which will show us the first five rows. It's like getting a sneak preview of the opening act before the main event. This simple step is crucial for ensuring we're on the right track and that our data is ready to roll."

While the output might be a bit more concise compared to its numerical counterpart, it still packs a punch.\n",

In this particular case, we've got a small amount of data with missing values—just `9 rows` out of `699`. That's a mere `0.012`, or less than 1% of the total dataset. With such a small fraction, I'm thinking we drop them like they're hot, using the `.dropna` method. And while we're at it, let’s break down the cool attributes that groove along with the `.dropna` method.\n",

    "- `Axis`: Decides if you're dropping rows or columns. `0` means rows, while `1` goes for columns.\n",
    "- `How`: Two vibes here—_any_ or _all_. If you choose `all`, it drops rows or columns that are completely empty. Opt for `any`, and it drops those with even a single missing value.\n",
    "- `Inplace`: This one's crucial. If you set `inplace=True`, changes will happen right on the DataFrame you're working with. If it's `False` (which is the default), the original DataFrame stays untouched, and a new one is returned.\n",

So, let's slide into it and make sure our dataset is as clean as a crisp vinyl record. Let’s do this! 🎷✨\n",

You may ask, \"Of all the previous process, they're not enough?\". Well apparently, it's not sufficient enough to meet the standards.\n",

Our dataset still consist some categorical values in them, the `doctors_name` and `class` columns are two of good examples. And Machine Learning algorithm don't normally like them. We need to modify these two columns, so that it would make it easier and less confusing for the machine learning model to process through. I came across this [great example](https://medium.com/@contactsunny/label-encoder-vs-one-hot-encoder-in-machine-learning-3fc273365621) on how to deal with the similar situation.\n"
